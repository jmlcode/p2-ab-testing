    "\n",
    "This project covers a span of topics related to practical statistics ranging from probability and hypothesis testing to regression. Common methods used by data analysts and data scientists in the field, which cover these topics, are A/B tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, analytical methods which leverage concepts from these topics were be applied to understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company had developed a new web page in order to increase the number of users who \"convert\" or decide to pay for the company's product. The analysis performed in this project aimed to provide the company with insights into whether the company should implement the new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment longer to make a decision.\n",

A potential disadvantage accompanied by this addition is the possibility of any correlation among the predictor variables added to the model to predict the outcome.

    "\n",
    "In this project, sampling distribution, two-sample Z-test, and logistic regressions were used to analyze the A/B tests conducted by the e-commerce company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relatively small p-values obtained from both the sampling distribution of the differences in the convert rates between the treatment and the control groups and the two-sample Z-test did not provide enough evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis. In other words, according to the A/B tests, the company was not recommended to implement the new page because the convert rate for the old page was determined to be equal to or larger than the convert rate for the new page. Additional data concerned with the context in which the timestamp of each transaction was recorded or the interpretation of these timestamps would introduce potential improvements to the A/B testing in that outcomes of transactions can be monitored continuously. Findings from a more comprehensive analysis would provide the company with insights into the optimal duration of the A/B testing before the company makes a decision on implementing the new page or keeping the old page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regressions did not provide similar p-values as the sampling distribution and the two-sample Z-test because the null and the alternative hypotheses for the logistic regressions were concerned with whether the outcome can be predicted with certain predictor variables. However, conversion of the p-value from the two-tail test to the one-tail test showed that the findings from the logistic regression also supported the null hypothesis. The first model aimed to predict the conversion with the landing page. The second model added country where the users live to the predictor variables of the first model. The third model included interaction terms among the predictor variables from the second model. From the first to the second and the third models, increase in the pseudo R-square suggested an increase in the capability of the model to account for the observed outcome and predict conversion."
